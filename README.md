EVOLVED

Purpose, this plugin makes your minecraft world more intresting and more realistic
Instead of the usual redstone this gets replaced with wires and power,
wich u will need to generate with solar panels, reactor or with a generator.

This plugin also comes with an economy feature to trade with players in a shop GUI.
u can also trade with the _world_ and not with players.
this means we have 2 shops

Playershop and Worldshop.

# Inside the plugin

- Power System (Grid System)
- Playershop/Worldshop
- Economy

# 1. Power System

the power system is a more realistic way of redstone, to create power u need something like a generator.
with this power u can fuel lights and make autominers.

# 2. Playershop/Worldshop

The playershop is a player to player shop, u can trade with people ingame.
The worldshop is a player to world shop, u can sell/buy directly from the world.
stocks are unlimited in worldshop, but it doesnt sell any rare+ items.

# 3. Economy

To function the shops u need money, and thats exactly what this is for.
Paying your friends is also an option!
